## Working example âœ…

_tsflex_ is built to be intuitive, so we encourage you to copy-paste this code and toy with some parameters! <br>

This executable example creates a feature-collection that contains 2 features (skewness and minimum). <br>
**Note**: we do not make any assumptions about the sampling rate of the time-series data.

```python
import pandas as pd; import scipy.stats as ss; import numpy as np
from tsflex.features import FeatureDescriptor, FeatureCollection, NumpyFuncWrapper

# 1. -------- Get your time-indexed data --------
series_size = 10_000
series_name="lux"

data = pd.Series(
    data=np.random.random(series_size), 
    index=pd.date_range("2021-07-01", freq="1h", periods=series_size)
).rename(series_name)
# -- 1.1 drop some data, as we don't make frequency assumptions
data = data.drop(np.random.choice(data.index, 200, replace=False))


# 2 -------- Construct your feature collection --------
fc = FeatureCollection(
    feature_descriptors=[
        FeatureDescriptor(
            function=NumpyFuncWrapper(func=ss.skew, output_names="skew"),
            series_name=series_name, 
            window="1day", stride="6hours"
        )
    ]
)
# -- 2.1. Add multiple features to your feature collection
fc.add(FeatureDescriptor(np.min, series_name, '2days', '1day'))

# 3 -------- Calculate features --------
fc.calculate(data=data, n_jobs=1, return_df=True)
# which outputs:
```
|      index          |  **lux__skew__w=1D_s=12h**  |   **lux__amin__w=2D_s=1D** |  **lux__...** |

## Getting started ðŸš€

### Classes & feature-output
![features uml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsflex/tsflex/main/docs/_static/features_uml.png)

As shown above, there are 3 relevant classes for feature-extraction.

1. [FeatureCollection](/tsflex/features/#tsflex.features.FeatureCollection): serves as a registry, withholding the to-be-calculated _features_
2. [FeatureDescriptor](/tsflex/features/#tsflex.features.FeatureDescriptor): an instance of this class describes a _feature_. <br>Features are defined by:
      * `series_name`: the names of the signal(s) which this feature will use. 
      * `function`: the _Callable_ feature-function - e.g. _np.mean_
      * `window`: the _time-based_ window -  e.g. _"1hour"_
      * `stride`: the _time-based_ stride - e.g. _"2days"_
3. [NumpyFuncWrapper](/tsflex/features/#tsflex.features.NumpyFuncWrapper): a wrapper around _Callable_ functions, intended for advanced feature function definitions, such as:
    * features with multiple output columns
    * passing _**kwargs_ to feature functions

The snippet below shows how the `FeatureCollection` & `FeatureDescriptor` class interplay:

```python
import numpy as np; import scipy.stats as ss
from tsflex.features import FeatureDescriptor, FeatureCollection

# The FeatureCollection takes a List[FeatureDescriptors] as input
fc = FeatureCollection(feature_descriptors=[
        # There is no need for NumpyFuncWrapper when using "simple" features
        FeatureDescriptor(np.mean, "series_a", "1hour", "15min"),
        FeatureDescriptor(ss.skew, "series_b", "3hours", "5min")
    ]
)

# We can still add features after instantiating.
fc.add(features=[FeatureDescriptor(np.std, "series_a", "1hour", "15min")])
fc.calculate(...)
```
<br>

### Output format
The output the `FeatureCollection` its `calculate` method is a (list of) **`time-indexed pd.DataFrame`** with column names<br>

> **`<SERIES-NAME>__<FEAT-NAME>__w=<WINDOW>__s=<STRIDE>`**.

The column-name for the feature defined on the penultimate line in the snipped above will thus be `series_a__std__w=1h__s=15m`.

!!!note
    You can find more information about the **input data-formats** in [this section](/tsflex/#data-formats) and read more about the (obvious) **limitations** in the next section.

<br>

## Limitations ðŸ“¢

It is important to note that there a still some, albeit logical, **limitations** regarding the supported [data format](/tsflex/#data-formats).<br>These limitations are:

1. Each [`ts`](/tsflex/#data-formats) must have a <b style="color:red">`pd.DatetimeIndex` that increases monotonically</b>
      - **Countermeasure**: Apply _[sort_index()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_index.html)_ on your not-monotonically increasing data
2. <b style="color:red">No duplicate</b> `ts` <b style="color:red">names</b> are allowed
      - **Countermeasure**: rename your `ts`
3. We support various data-types. e.g. (np.float32, string-data, time-based data). However, it is the end-users responsibility to use a function which interplays nicely with the data's format.

<br>

## Advanced usage ðŸ‘€

<!-- TODO: tot hier geraakt -->

### Multivariate-data
There are no assumptions made about the `data` its `time-ranges`.<br>
However, the end-user must take some things in consideration.

### Multiple time series

* functions that work on **multiple time-series**: see the `tsflex.chunking` module for more info.


### Irregularly sampled data

This case may cause that not all windows on which features are calculated have the same amount of samples.<br>
When using multivariate data, with either different sample rates or with an irregular data-rate, you cannot make the assumption that all windows will have the same length. Your feature extraction method will thus
